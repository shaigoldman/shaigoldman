### Hi there 👋

😄 I am an undergraduate student at Columbia University majoring in Computer Science.

☁️ This summer I am interning at Oracle Cloud Infrastructure for the Compute Imaging team!

💻 From 2020-21 I was creating algorithms to analyze human intracranial EEG data using python with the [Electrophysiology, Memory, and Navigation Laboratory](http://orion.bme.columbia.edu/jacobs/) at Columbia.

🔭 In high school I worked for the [Computational Memory Lab](http://memory.psych.upenn.edu/Main_Page) at Penn, analyzing behavioral memory data in human free recall.
